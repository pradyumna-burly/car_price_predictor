# Car Price Predictor
Welcome to the Car Price Prediction project! This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning application designed to predict car prices based on various features. Below you'll find an overview of the project, its components, and how to get started.

# Project Overview
The Car Price Prediction project leverages a linear regression model to estimate the price of cars. It includes a web interface for users to input car features and receive price predictions. The model has been trained using historical car data and is packaged for deployment in a Python web application.

# Project Structure
Here's a breakdown of the files and directories included in this repository:

# HTML/CSS:

1. index.html: The main HTML file that provides the structure of the web interface.
2. styles.css: The CSS file used to style the web interface.

# Application Code: 
application.py: The main Python script that runs the web application using Flask. It handles user inputs, interacts with the linear regression model, and renders predictions.

# Model:
linearregressionmodel.pkl: The serialized linear regression model used for making predictions. This file is loaded by application.py to provide car price estimates.

# Data:
cleaned_data.csv: The cleaned dataset used for training the linear regression model. This file contains historical data on car features and prices.

# Notebook:
notebook.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that details the data analysis and model training process. This notebook includes code for data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

# Scripts:
A folder named scripts/ containing any additional Python scripts used for data preprocessing, feature engineering, or other tasks related to model development.
