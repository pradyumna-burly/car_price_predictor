# Car Price Predictor
Welcome to the Car Price Prediction project! This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning application designed to predict car prices based on various features. Below you'll find an overview of the project, its components, and how to get started.

Project Overview
The Car Price Prediction project leverages a linear regression model to estimate the price of cars. It includes a web interface for users to input car features and receive price predictions. The model has been trained using historical car data and is packaged for deployment in a Python web application.

Project Structure
Here's a breakdown of the files and directories included in this repository:

HTML/CSS:

index.html: The main HTML file that provides the structure of the web interface.
styles.css: The CSS file used to style the web interface.
Application Code:

application.py: The main Python script that runs the web application using Flask. It handles user inputs, interacts with the linear regression model, and renders predictions.
Model:

linearregressionmodel.pkl: The serialized linear regression model used for making predictions. This file is loaded by application.py to provide car price estimates.
Data:

cleaned_data.csv: The cleaned dataset used for training the linear regression model. This file contains historical data on car features and prices.
Notebook:

notebook.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that details the data analysis and model training process. This notebook includes code for data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
Scripts:

A folder named scripts/ containing any additional Python scripts used for data preprocessing, feature engineering, or other tasks related to model development.
Getting Started
To get started with the Car Price Prediction project, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
Flask
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
Jupyter Notebook (for running the notebook)
You can install the necessary Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install flask scikit-learn pandas numpy
Running the Application
Start the Flask Application:
Navigate to the directory containing application.py and run:

bash
Copy code
python application.py
This will start the Flask web server. By default, the application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Open the Web Interface:
Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/. You should see the Car Price Prediction web interface where you can input car features and get price predictions.

Exploring the Notebook
To view the data analysis and model training process:

Open notebook.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
Review the steps taken for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
